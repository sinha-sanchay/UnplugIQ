# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern, responsive React frontend application that provides a complete user interface for a challenge-based platform. The frontend will connect to the existing Spring Boot backend and provide authentication, challenge browsing, submission functionality, and user management capabilities. The application will feature a clean, intuitive design with proper routing, state management, and responsive layouts that work across desktop and mobile devices.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user types in the submission text area THEN the system SHALL provide real-time character count feedback
3. WHEN a user submits a valid response THEN the system SHALL save the submission and display a success message
4. WHEN a user submits an empty response THEN the system SHALL display a validation error
5. WHEN a submission is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect to a confirmation page or update the UI to show submission status

2. WHEN a user views their submission history THEN the system SHALL display all their submissions with challenge titles and dates
3. WHEN a user clicks on a submission in their history THEN the system SHALL navigate to the challenge detail page
4. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics (total submissions, challenges completed)
5. WHEN a user accesses profile settings THEN the system SHALL allow viewing but not editing of account information
6. WHEN a user has no submissions THEN the system SHALL display an encouraging message to start participating

### Requirement 5: Responsive Design and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the application on any device with intuitive navigation, so that I can access challenges whether I'm on desktop or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout optimized for small screens
